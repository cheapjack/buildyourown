***Desktop Prosthetics (2015)***
DoESLiverpool: Ross Dalziel, Patrick Fenner and Adrian McEwen
 
***DoESLiverpool*** presents an iteration of the open-source project e-NABLE, a global network of passionate volunteers using 3D printing to make prosthetic hands. Inspired by a local family who used DoESLiverpool's workshop to print hand parts, DoES has installed a ‘production line’ for prosthetic hands. They will be 3D printing the open-source Raptor Hand design, which is more of a tool rather than a fully functional prosthetic device, developed to make printing and assembly of the hand’s components as simple as possible.
 
***Desktop Prosthetics*** aims to raise awareness of some of the practical uses of 3D printing and to demonstrate how collaborative communities like DoES and e-NABLE work, sharing skills and specialised knowledge to solve problems.
 
Over the course of the exhibition, DoESLiverpool will be working with ***Reach***, the association for children with upper limb deficiency, to help a number of local children build and assemble a prosthetic device. DoES invites you to get involved with testing and building prosthetics, to better understand what prosthetics are, and to see how access to rapid prototyping and open-source digital-making tools can help people make the world the way they want it. Check the events panel for more details on how to take part.
