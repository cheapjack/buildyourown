**DoESLiverpool** presents an iteration of the open-source project Enabling the Future, a global network of passionate volunteers using 3D printing to give the world a 'helping hand'. Inspired by a local family who used DoESLiverpool's workshop to print hand parts independently, DoES has installed a ‘production line’ for prosthetic hands. They will be using 3D printing technology and the open-source "Raptor Hand" design, which was developed to make printing and assembly of the hand’s components easier for their makers and recipients.

**DesktopProsthetics** aims to raise awareness of some of the more practical uses of 3D printing and demonstrates how collaborative communities like DoES and Enabling the Future work together - sharing skills and specialised knowledge to solve real problems.
[Also add something for visualisation? – CC needs to confirm this]

Over the course of the exhibition, DoES Liverpool will be working with **Reach**, the association for children with upper limb deficiency, to help a number of local children build and assemble a prosthetic device. We invite you to get involved in testing and building prosthetics, experiment and understand what prosthetics are and how access to rapid prototyping and open source digital making tools can help people make the world the way they want it. Check the events panel for more details on how to take part.

Developed with the support of Reach and E-nabling the Future
