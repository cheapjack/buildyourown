* Space Setup: L shape in middle of G1 space: like the blue panels in image below but so space visible through the G1 window

* On 4 Wall mounted shelves in a ‘run’: 2 x Ultimaker 2 fully perforated pegboard sheetshttps://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-2-family The ultimakers footprint is W 338 x D 358 x H 289 mm so dont know if we can use your standard shelf to support that; may need them a bit deeper and with extra support for safety, not sure on weight. We thought we have a setup as above but with an extra panel on the right, with the 3 printers spaced out on the shelves but with complete peg board panels behind for displaying/storing printed components; maybe one of the four could be hit and miss panels for any warning/info signs: Not sure yet if we’d need a cabinet for all the components or something hanging on the perforated boards. Run power up the back of the panels

### 5 steps of  design/build story 
On wall mounted shelves, possibly with clear vitrine with mix of hit and miss panels for displaying info, but 2 pegboard panels in the mix.
### 5 'plinths' essentially

1. Measuring & Model
 * Measuring hands and using the Enabling The Futures [Handomatic](http://webapp.e-nable.me/ "Link to the Handomatic Web App") Web Application
 * Exhibits:
  * A set of calipers for measuring
  * A tablet (provided by FACT) running the Handomatic app to show the digital model

2. Print
  * Print instruction diagram

3. Tidy parts
  * Use tools from the toolbench to help clear/clean and prep components for assembly

4. Collect Things

5. Assembly

* Another table or multi-accessible workbench with space for assembly and prepping of components
  * all the things you can play with. 
  * Up printer possibly on here
  * Toolbench
    * We need tools to help prep the components possibly making dowels for sanding components down
    * Gloves and safety glasses and pliers, could be stored on the pegboards behind the printer 'plinths'/shelves
  * This is the space for assembly/workshopping. 
  * Power
  * Wheelchair accessible as image above:
  * Mix of benches and individual stools?

* Print Queue server management using [OctoPrint](http://octoprint.org/ "Octoprint website") print queue system run off pi or tablet, potentially So there may be a way of alerting the person whose pieces are being printed
