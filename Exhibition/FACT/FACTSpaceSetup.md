* On 4 Wall mounted shelves in a ‘run’: 2 x Ultimaker Printers, all fully perforated pegboard sheetshttps://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-2-family The ultimakers footprint is W 338 x D 358 x H 289 mm so dont know if we can use your standard shelf to support that; may need them a bit deeper and with extra support for safety, not sure on weight. We thought we have a setup as above but with an extra panel on the right, with the 3 printers spaced out on the shelves but with complete peg board panels behind for displaying/storing printed components; maybe one of the four could be hit and miss panels for any warning/info signs. Run power up the back of the panels

* The peg board around the printers will hold a number of clear storage bins - 8-12 larger ones (such as the [Storbox Big](http://www.shopfittings4u.co.uk/product_group.asp?parseid=85&i=116)) to hold spare printer filament, and around 15 smaller ones (such as the [Storbox Cube](http://www.shopfittings4u.co.uk/product_group.asp?parseid=84&i=116)) to store tools and the printed hand parts.

### "5 steps to a new hand"
On wall mounted shelves, possibly with clear vitrine with mix of hit and miss panels for displaying info

**5 'plinths' essentially**

1. Measuring & Model
  * Measuring hands and using the Enabling The Futures [Handomatic](http://webapp.e-nable.me/ "Link to the Handomatic Web App") Web Application
  * Exhibits:
    * A set of calipers for measuring
    * A tablet (provided by FACT) running the Handomatic app to show the digital model

> _**Q: [Do we need to secure the calipers?](https://github.com/cheapjack/buildyourown/issues/18)**_

2. Print
  * Print instruction diagram plus a set of straight-off-the-3d-printer printed parts
  * Exhibits, in a vitrine:
    * A full set of straight-off-the-3d-printer printed parts

3. Tidy parts
  * Use tools from the toolbench to help clear/clean and prep components for assembly
  * Exhibits, in a vitrine:
    * A set of parts with support material, etc. removed
    * A hand-drill
    * A Stanley knife
    * A scalpel
    * A cutting mat
    * A collection of bits of support material

* Another table or multi-accessible workbench with space for assembly and prepping of components
  * all the things you can play with. 
  * Up printer possibly on here
  * Toolbench
    * We need tools to help prep the components possibly making dowels for sanding components down
    * Gloves and safety glasses and pliers, could be stored on the pegboards behind the printer 'plinths'/shelves
  * This is the space for assembly/workshopping. 
  * Power
  * Wheelchair accessible as image above:
  * Mix of benches and individual stools?

* Print Queue server management using [OctoPrint](http://octoprint.org/ "Octoprint website") print queue system run off pi or tablet, potentially So there may be a way of alerting the person whose pieces are being printed
