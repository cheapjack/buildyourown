* Space Setup: L shape in middle of G1 space: like the blue panels in image below but so space visible through the G1 window

* On 4 Wall mounted shelves in a ‘run’: 2 x Ultimaker 2 fully perforated pegboard sheetshttps://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-2-family The ultimakers footprint is W 338 x D 358 x H 289 mm so dont know if we can use your standard shelf to support that; may need them a bit deeper and with extra support for safety, not sure on weight. We thought we have a setup as above but with an extra panel on the right, with the 3 printers spaced out on the shelves but with complete peg board panels behind for displaying/storing printed components; maybe one of the four could be hit and miss panels for any warning/info signs: Not sure yet if we’d need a cabinet for all the components or something hanging on the perforated boards. Run power up the back of the panels

* 5 steps of  design/build story on wall mounted shelves, possibly with clear vitrine with mix of hit and miss panels for displaying info, but 2 pegboard panels in the mix

* Another table or multi-accessible workbench with all the things you can play with. This is the space for assembly/workshopping. Use existing stools. Like these but at a height a wheelchair could work with, and maybe 2 back to back? so work at them like a workbench with power

* Print Queue server management using [OctoPrint](http://octoprint.org/ "Octoprint website") print queue system run off pi or tablet, potentially So there may be a way of alerting the person whose pieces are being printed
