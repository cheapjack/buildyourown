###e-NABLE Policy Reminder by
###e-NABLE Support and Matcher Teams

First, thank you!  e-NABLE would be impossible without our amazing volunteers who donate their time, talents, filament and printer time to create prosthetic  these hands for people all over the world.

Second, please remember that our our collective success and reputation rests on your shoulders.  
Please make sure you abide by our policies.

1).  Make sure you have filled out our intake form at http://goo.gl/lW1uX6.  We can not match you with anyone until this information is received. 

2.)  If you have been matched by someone local to you, please refrain from having recipients in your home or visiting them at their residence. We know everyone is here to help, and that residential meetings may be more convenient and personal, but it is crucial that we avoid the complicated and potentially negative situation that could result. 

Some recommended locations for meeting with recipients and their families:
• Local Library
• Mall food courts
• Local park with picnic tables (for tools etc if needed)
• Local restaurants (kid friendly if you are meeting with a family!)
• Some science museums have open areas/Food courts etc

3.)  We sometimes work with under-age recipients who proactively find their own way to us.  This is admirable, but parental permission is required and correspondence should be overseen by the parent/guardian. If you notice a post in the community by a potential recipient who appears to be under the age of 18, please tag Jen Owen or Melina Brown in the comments.  

Abiding by these simple policies...religiously!... keeps our recipients and our organization safe.  
 When you abide by these simple policies, you are enabling the future we all want.
If you deviate from them, you put us all in jeopardy.

If you have questions about your own practices, or about those of another e-NABLE volunteer, please email enablematcher@gmail.com or jschull@enablecommunityfoundation.org
