# What is the Desktop Prosthetics project?

## Overview

For a synopsis of the project, the [README.md](https://github.com/cheapjack/buildyourown/blob/master/README.md) is best.  This document is to give more background and explanation of the project for us to share with partners and other interested parties (e.g. press) for more in-depth info.

## What?



## Who?

The project is being led by the maker community of [DoES Liverpool](http://doesliverpool.com).  Specifically, [Ross Dalziel](http://cheapjackprojects.tumblr.com/), [Adrian McEwen](http://www.mcqn.com) and [Patrick Fenner](http://www.deferredprocrastination.co.uk/).

Collaborators and partners:

## Where and When?

During the exhibitions there will be a series of workshops.  These will be open to all and cover a range of activities - measuring and then assembling hands for members of the Reach community; and exploring new possibilities offered by the inherent personalisation provided by 3d-printed manufacturing techniques.  Details of the events are being developed in the [events section](https://github.com/cheapjack/buildyourown/tree/master/events) of our project management site.

paragraph on makerspaces and hackspaces
what exactly is a makerspace? Using the term broadly, we’re talking about public spaces with different tools and equipment where people can go to independently make something. While we need to appreciate the diversity of these spaces, it’s also important to think beyond formalised networks (like Fab Labs) and focus on spaces defined by a specific ethos (like Hackspaces).
