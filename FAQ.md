# Desktop Prosthetics - Frequently Asked Questions

This page provides answers to some of the more frequently asked questions about the Desktop Prosthetics project.  See the [Background](Background.md) page for more general information about the exhibition and people involved.

[Enabling the Future](http://enablingthefuture.org/), the global project whose designs we'll be using for the prosthetics have [an extensive FAQ](http://enablingthefuture.org/faqs/media-faq/) which is worth reading through in addition to this one.

### How long does the actual process of printing a hand take?

As each hand is custom to its recipient - varying a bit in size, but also customised based on the person's needs, with/without a thumb, etc. - there's no exact answer.  However,

Taking one of the hands we've printed as an example, there are 14 parts in total:

 * Gauntlet - 10 h 39 m, 69.7g of plastic
 * Palm - 16 h 45 m, 96.2g of plastic
 * Fingers - 13 h 53 m, 79.8g of plastic
 * Other parts - 5 h 13 m, 30.5g of plastic
 * Hinge caps - 0 h 26 m, 2.8g of plastic

So in total that's 47 hours of printing and 280g of plastic.  The weight includes the support material used during the printing, which is removed later, but when you add the metal hinge pins and cords, the resultant weight will probably be similar.

### What materials are used?

The particular plastics used will depend on the 3d printer and what materials it can print.  Generally it will be either ABS (the same plastic Lego is made from) or PLA (a plant-based thermoplastic which has similar properties to ABS).  Enabling the Future recommend printing in PLA, so we'll be using that for the hands we print in the exhibition.

In addition to the plastic parts there are a number of metal screws and nuts, some elastic and cord, foam padding, velcro, etc. used to hold the parts together and attach them to the user's arm.

### What operations are possible with these prosthetics?

See the "Q: What can these 3D printed hands be used for?" question in the [Enabling the Future Media FAQ](http://enablingthefuture.org/faqs/media-faq/)

### Who will be helped through this project?

By working with [Reach](http://reach.org.uk/), the association for children with upper limb deficiency, we'll be helping a number of children (primarily) from the North-West and East Anglia.  In addition, the exhibition will raise awareness within the Reach community and the general public about some of the more practical uses for 3d printing.

### Is this a project DoES Liverpool is looking to expand?

> _**Need to fill this in with the answer we work out**_

### What limits are there, if any, with 3D printing?

Like any manufacturing technique, 3d printing has its advantages and disadvantages.  3d printing also covers a range of different techniques, and possible materials, with the resulting printers ranging in price from a few hundred pound into tens of thousands of pounds.

As the Enabling the Future project is geared towards democratising access to prosthetics, we're using printers from the more affordable end of the range which print in plastic (rather than resin or metal).  This type of printing can only print in one or sometimes two colours of material at a time; and while the prints are surprisingly robust, the printing technique gives the models a sort of "grain" - like you get in wood - where it's weaker when subject to forces along that grain.
