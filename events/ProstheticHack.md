## Saturday 25th July FACT Gallery 1 12pm-4.30pm FREE
**Age 3 and above, children accompanied by an adult**

## DoESLiverpool will be hosting a prosthetic hackday exploring how the **DesktopProsthetics** project, part of Build Your Own, can be hacked and modified to explore the diversity of prosthetic design. 
### The Raptor hand used in **DesktopProsthetics** is a general pick up and place prosthetic but with rapid prototyping tools like 3D printing can we develop modifications or 'hacks' for the reality of unique users? What prosthetics could we make for hiphop MC's, dancers, mathematicians, event organisers, farmers, gallery assistants or engineers?  We will explore prosthetic hand design as a group then prototype and present our co-designs.

We will also be looking at how to adapt the Raptor Re-Loaded for those families with no conventional working wrist joint. Take part in co-design and simple making activity and explore 3D generation tools from [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) to **Lego®**
